# Statistical Analysis
This data set had 60,000 training and 10,000 testing with grey scale images. The dimentions of all are 28 times 29 pixels. 
- The images were reshaped for chennel dimentioning with (28,28,1) which is nessary for convolutional processing.
- The output of the image used 3 convolutional layers with max pool to extract spatial features and then by 2 dense layers classifed them into 10 categories.
- The total parameters were 1,618,698. 
- The trainable parametere were also 1,618,698.
- There was 0 non-trainable parameters.
- The model size is 6.17 MB.
