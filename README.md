# Fashion_MNIST Data Set
- This project demonstrates the Keras deep learning library that helps create an artificial neural network built on Tensorflow.

## Requirements
- This dataset requires the kernel VSCode that can run a Python environment.

## How to Run
- In order to run this code, you must activate a Python environment installed on your computer and activated. You can download "FASHION.py" into a folder, and open the folder within VSCode.
- The Fashion_MNIST dataset is automatically downloaded and loaded in the script, so no external dataset installations are required.
